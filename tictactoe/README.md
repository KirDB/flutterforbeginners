Sample projects created in flutter for beginners

This is a sample project for those who are trying to explore flutter. This branch contains a single file project for Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in flutter with help of Android studio.
Once the flutter app was created, only 2 files are changed in this.

1. main.dart - removed all the default app code and implemented tic-tac-toe game here.(All methods, constants , states are all maintained here)
2. pubspec.yaml - this file added new dependency to try blinking text.
